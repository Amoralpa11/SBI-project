FUNCTIONS
    clean_heteroatoms(interaction_dict)
    
    clean_interaction_dict(interaction_dict, similar_sequences)
        Takes an dictionary with tuples of 2 strings and a list of lists of chains and a dictionary with chains as
        keys and similar chains as values and removes chain pairs interacting in a similar way from the interaction dict
    
    compare_chains(chain1, chain2, seq_dict)
        Takes two chain objects and return true if their sequences are more than 95% simmilar and False if not
    
    compare_interactions(interaction1, interaction2, similar_sequences)
        This function takes two structures with two chains each one and a dictionary with chains as keys and keys as
        values relating them if they have more than a 95% of similarity and returns 1 if the two interactions are
        different and 0 if they are the same interaction
    
    get_all_interaction_pairs(pdb_filename, print_files=True)
        Takes a pdb file path and generates a folder with all the pairs of interacting chains without checking if there is redundant content. This simulates the user input
    
    get_id_dict(structure_list)
        Takes a list of structures and returns a dictionary with chains as keys and unique idenfiers as values
    
    get_id_list()
        returns a list of all the combinations of two letters
    
    get_interaction_pairs(pdb_filename)
        This function Takes a pdb file path and generates a folder with pdb files holding the unique pairwise interactions in the first pdb
    
    get_interaction_pairs_from_input(directory)
        Takes the path of a directory and returns a list holding the interaction dictionary of the pdbs in this directory, a similar chains dictionary and a dictionary that relates every chain with its id
    
    get_neighbor_chains(structure)
        Takes an strucutre and return a dicionary with chains as keys and a list of chains as values holding the
        chains with alpha carbons at less than 8 amgstrongs from an alpha carbon of the key chain
    
    get_numeric_array(seq_aln)
        Takes a sequence alignment and returns an array with numbers instead of residues
    
    get_pdb_from_directory(directory)
        Takes a directory path and return a list of strings holding the names of pdb files in the directory
    
    get_seq_dict(chain_list)
        Takes a list of chains and returns a dictionary with chain objects as keys and strings holding their sequences as
        values
    
    get_sequence_from_chain(chain)
        Takes a chain and returns an string holding its sequence in a single character code
    
    get_similar_sequences(chain_list, seq_dict)
        Takes a list of chain objects and a dictionary with chains as keys and their sequence as values and returns a
        dictionary with every chain as a key and a chain they are similar to as value
    
    get_structure_name(filename)
        Takes a .pdb file name, returns the string without extension
    
    trim_to_superimpose(chain1, chain2)
        Takes two chains and removes the residues that do not have a match in the sequence alignment
